## Authored Projects

[**Sherpa**](https://github.com/jrasell/sherpa) is a horizontal job scaler for HashiCorp Nomad. It can be configured in a number of ways providing a flexible setup for a range of architectures and budgets. The server exposes an API which can be used to configure scaling polices and trigger scaling actions and can also run an internal autoscaler.
